# MDAGCN

MDAGCN: predicting mutation-drug associations through signed graph convolutional networks via graph sampling



![](/MDAGCN-main/workflow.png)

 An overview of our proposed MDAGCN model

1) We generated an in-house benchmark data set of anti-cancer drug sensitivity/resistance mutations, promoting the research and development of computational methodology.
2) We proposed a GCN model based on signed graphs, named MDAGCN, which utilizes a graph sampler to extract subgraphs to predict mutation-drug associations with specific types.
3) We adopted the normalization techniques and a light-weight sampling algorithm, improving the model training accuracy.
4) We designed extensive experiments to show the proposed method has achieved better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in predicting mutation-drug associations with types.



## Datasets
· D_SM.txt：drug-similarity matrix, which is calculated based on drug features.  
· M_SM.txt：mutation-similarity matrix, which is calculated based on mutation features.  
· drug_mutation_pairs.csv: the drug-mutation association network.  
· all mutation feature 661x248.csv：mutation feature matrix
· all_drug_feature_184x231.csv：drug feature matrix



## Run the MDAGCN
1. pip install -r MDAGCN_requirements.txt

***note: When a required library cannot be downloaded automatically, it is advisable to download and install it manually.

2. Construct MDP graph.ipynb

***note: All data required by the runtime is stored in the data file. Be sure to update the file path carefully when necessary.

3. 2_data preprocessing to model.ipynb

***note： All the data required at runtime is generated by the Construct MDP graph code.
   
4. Train and test, for example:

python -m graphsaint.pytorch_version.train_saveys --data_prefix drug_mutation_data/task_Tp__testlabel0_3knn_edge_fold0  --train_config graphsaint/parameters_epoch_1.yml

***note: Run the data using the terminal, ensuring that both the code and file paths are correct. Use the input data from the drug_mutation_data file, or, if necessary, generate your own data by running the 2_data_preprocessing_to_model_type1.ipynb script.


## Comparative experiments
machine learning file: includes code for decision trees (DTs), random forests (RF), and extremely random trees (ERTs).

state-of-the-art methods file: includes code for gcmc, SGCN, SNEA, TDRC, SGNNMD and NMCMDA.

In addition, the code for these comparison experiments is executable, ensuring the transparency of the experiments.
